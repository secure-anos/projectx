            referring to the Company and/or to any other sites that We may choose to operate in the future.
            Additionally,
            when
            the terms “the Site” or “Site” or the “Website” are used, these terms refer to https://Project X/, any
            predecessor or successor domain or URL, along with any website published by Us, unless a site is
            specifically
            exempt
            from this Agreement. Our Site(s), and the services available to the Site and that the Site provides
            (“Services”),
            may contain images and videos (collectively referred to as the “Content”) and text, software, graphics,
            data,
            messages, or any other information, and any other website content owned, operated, licensed, or controlled

            1.1.2. You, the User. As the User of this Site and/or Services, this Agreement will refer to the User as
            “You”
            or
            through any second-person pronouns, such as “Yours” etc. Hereinafter, the User of the Site and/or Services
            shall
            be

            Members
            are Users, but not all Users are Members. This Agreement applies to all Users whether they are Members or
            not.
            You
            become a User by accessing this Site or the Services in any way, therefore You need not become a Member of
            the
            Site
            to have this Agreement applied to You. You are not considered a Member, as defined by this Agreement, until
            such
            time as You have submitted Your online account Registration (hereinafter “Registration”). You become a

            or by
            enabling and registering with other available means of registration defined in Our Website. Registration is
            available without the provision of Your e-mail address. Also, registration is available via “Sign up with

            the
            Creators’ Program.<br>

            by
            the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act), Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of

            up
            with
            Google” function in order to register on Our Website. YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THIS HAS THE SAME LEGAL
            EFFECT
            AS
            YOU PLACING YOUR PHYSICAL SIGNATURE ON ANY OTHER LEGAL CONTRACT. If You click any link, button, or other
            device
            provided to You in any part of Our Site’s interface, then You have legally agreed to all of these Terms and
            Conditions. Additionally, by using any of Our Site or Services in any manner, including uploading Your
            Content
            to

            unconditional acceptance to all of the terms in this Agreement.<br>

            1.2.2. If You fail to sign this Agreement, You understand that You are an unauthorized user of the Site and
            Services. No act or omission by Us should be interpreted as a waiver of the requirement that You assent to
            this
            Agreement. If You fail to do so, You are still bound by the terms of this Agreement by virtue of Your
            viewing of
